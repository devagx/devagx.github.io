				<p>
					I’m Alun, an accomplished Software Engineer with a history of developing innovative, high-quality
					web-based software applications and Web API's. Recently achieved industry recognised cyber security
					and Microsoft certifications while taking a keen interest in developing secure web applications and
					Web API's utilising secure coding practices and OWASP Top 10 methodologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					My strong commercial acumen and added value focus have been key to my success. I’m completely
					conversant in Java, C#.NET, JavaScript, Visual Studio, Windows and Linux. Collaborative and team
					oriented, I operate successfully in a collaborative, fast-paced Agile, continuous integration
					environments, capably handling challenges, change, complexity and pressure.

					I spent 12 years with Basware, joining as Senior Integration Consultant, with promotion to Lead
					Integration Consultant in 2016, working on A+ customer base Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) and Invoice
					Automation (IA) global enterprise projects, around the globe either remotely or on site. I was
					responsible at critical level for designing, developing and implementing best in class software
					solutions and services. Notably I was technical lead of a team of 6 and owner of global architecture
					design and functionality design for a new system implementation for a technology company.
				</p>
				<p>
					My technical expertise is broad, including experience of software development, database knowledge
					and testing expertise. My proficiency in test driven development (TDD) and behaviour driven
					development (BDD) processes is excellent. Highly driven, I welcome technically challenging, business
					critical projects. I’m accustomed to operating in cross-sector blue chip environments and driven to
					exceed customer expectation. Well-qualified, I have a degree in Computing plus industry
					certifications. I rapidly assimilate rapidly to new environments and teams.
